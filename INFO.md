# Home Assistant OpenAI Service

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

This **Service** for Home Assistant allows you to generate text responses using OpenAI's GPT-3 model or a locally managed LLM.

Head to **[This Link](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)** to get your API key from OpenAI.
> **Note:** If you don't like to pay for the cloud OpenAI service, you can run your own LLM.
